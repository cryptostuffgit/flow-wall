## A social network that faciliates selling profiles

### About
The rise of the creator economy has led to a growing demand for social media accounts with large followings. Brands are increasingly interested in purchasing these accounts, but the process has been complicated by the need to transfer account passwords in escrow. This creates a significant risk for both the buyer and the seller, as passwords can be changed at any time, leaving one party without access to the account.

To solve this problem, our project has created a solution that leverages blockchain technology. We have developed profiles as flow resources that can be easily moved between accounts, ensuring that funds can be safely transferred on chain in exchange for profiles. This innovative approach streamlines the process of purchasing and selling social media accounts, making it more secure and efficient for all parties involved. With our solution, brands and creators alike can confidently engage in the emerging creator economy, without worrying about the risks associated with password transfers.
